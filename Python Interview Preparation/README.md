## Basics-0

#### Data Types

- Understanding and working with various data types:
  ```python
  # Example
  num = 42
  name = "John"
  coordinates = (10.5, 20.0)
  ```

#### Operators

- Utilizing operators for arithmetic, comparison, logical operations:
  ```python
  # Example
  result = 10 + 5  # Addition
  is_equal = (3 == 3)  # Comparison
  logical_result = True and False  # Logical AND
  ```

#### Variables

- Declaring and using variables to store values:
  ```python
  # Example
  age = 25
  message = f"My age is {age}."
  ```

#### Control Flow

- Implementing control flow structures such as if statements, loops:
  ```python
  # Example
  if age >= 18:
      print("You are an adult.")
  else:
      print("You are a minor.")
  
  # Loop example
  for i in range(5):
      print(i)
  ```
