l_odd_numbers = [1,3,5,7,9] # list



#### Operators

logical_result = True and False  # Logical AND

#### Variables
##### Declaring and using variables to store values:

# Example
age = 30

#### Control Flow
##### Implementing control flow structures such as if statements, loops:

# Loop example
start = 0
end = 5
step = 1
for idx in range(start, end, step):
    print(idx)
