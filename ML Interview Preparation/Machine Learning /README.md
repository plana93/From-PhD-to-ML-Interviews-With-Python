### Linear Regression 

Linear regression is a machine learning algorithm that explores relationships between variables, particularly between the output (dependent variable) and one or more inputs (independent variables). 
The fundamental equation is _y=mx+b_, where _y_ is the output, _x_ is the input, _m_ is the slope of the line, and _b_ is the bias.

The goal is to find a function that maps certain features or variables to others. 
Regression answers questions about how one phenomenon influences another or how different variables are correlated. 
It is also useful for making predictions with new data.

To obtain the best predictive weights, the algorithm minimizes residual errors, which are the differences between predicted and actual responses. 
This is achieved by reducing the sum of squared residuals (SSR) for all observations, known as the method of ordinary least squares.

When to use:
- easy simple to train and implement 
- quick: can be done in one-shot or gradient descent 
- handles linear data very well 

When not to use: 
- not linear relation (complex relation) 
- noise  
- outliers
- prone to overfitting 
- maybe need extra time for pre-processing or feature engineering
