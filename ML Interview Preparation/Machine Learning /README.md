### Linear Regression 

Regression searches for relationships among variables. 
Generally, in regression analysis, you consider some phenomenon of interest and have a number of observations. 
Each observation has two or more features. 
Following the assumption that at least one of the features depends on the others, you try to establish a relation among them.

In other words, you need to find a function that maps some features or variables to others sufficiently well.

Typically, you need regression to answer **whether and how some phenomenon influences the other** 
or **how several variables are related**. 
Regression is also useful when you want to **forecast** a response using a new set of predictors.
